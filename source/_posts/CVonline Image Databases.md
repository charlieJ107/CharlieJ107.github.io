This is a collated list of image and video databases that people    have found useful for computer vision research and algorithm evaluation.

An important article    [How Good Is My Test Data? Introducing Safety Analysis for Computer Vision](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-017-1020-z)    (by Zendel, Murschitz, Humenberger, and Herzner)    introduces a methodology for ensuring that your dataset has sufficient    variety that algorithm results on the dataset are representative of    the results that one could expect in a real setting.    In particular, the team have produced a    [Checklist](https://vitro-testing.com/cv-hazop/) of potential    hazards (imaging situations) that may cause algorithms to have problems.    Ideally, test datasets should have examples of the relevant hazards.
